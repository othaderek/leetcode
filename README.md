# leetcode (and codewars solutions)

These are my Leetcode and Codewars solutions in Javascript and Ruby. 

I also started adding implementations of different sorting algorithms
from Colt Steel's Data Structures and Algorithms course on Udemy.
They are all in Javascript.

Once I get better at Java and C I will start doing LC and CW solutions in those languages.

Note: After every question I do, I will answer 'What would I have to have known to make this problem easier to solve?'

That's it.
